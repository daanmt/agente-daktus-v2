Sempre siga as orientações do seu endocrinologista ou da equipe de saúde.</p></blockquote><hr><h2>1. O que é o Diabetes?</h2><p>O <strong>diabetes</strong> é uma condição em que o corpo não consegue usar corretamente o açúcar (glicose) do sangue. Isso pode acontecer porque:</p><ul><li><p><strong>O corpo não produz insulina</strong> (como no Diabetes Tipo 1)</p></li><li><p><strong>O corpo não usa bem a insulina que produz</strong> (como no Diabetes Tipo 2)</p></li><li><p>Ou uma combinação das duas coisas.</p></li></ul><p>A insulina é o “chaveiro” que permite que o açúcar entre nas células para ser usado como energia.<br>Sem ela funcionando direito, o açúcar se acumula no sangue — e isso pode prejudicar órgãos como olhos, rins, coração e nervos.</p><hr><h2>2. Alimentação — Seu maior aliado</h2><p>A dieta é tão importante quanto os remédios.<br>Aqui vão <strong>regras práticas</strong>:</p><h3>🍽 Fracionamento das refeições</h3><ul><li><p>Faça <strong>3 refeições principais</strong> (café da manhã, almoço, jantar)</p></li><li><p>Acrescente <strong>1 a 3 pequenos lanches</strong> se orientado pelo médico/nutricionista.</p></li><li><p>Evite pular refeições — isso pode causar <strong>hipoglicemia</strong> (queda de açúcar).</p></li></ul><h3>🍞 Escolha de carboidratos</h3><ul><li><p>Prefira <strong>carboidratos integrais</strong>: arroz integral, pão integral, aveia, batata-doce, mandioca.</p></li><li><p>Evite <strong>açúcares simples</strong>: refrigerantes, sucos industrializados, doces, mel.</p></li><li><p>Sempre <strong>combine carboidratos com proteínas ou fibras</strong> para evitar picos de glicose.</p></li></ul><h3>🥩 Proteínas e gorduras</h3><ul><li><p>Prefira carnes magras, peixes, ovos, queijos magros e leguminosas (feijão, lentilha).</p></li><li><p>Use óleos saudáveis: azeite de oliva, óleo de canola.</p></li><li><p>Evite frituras frequentes e gorduras trans.</p></li></ul><h3>🥗 Hortaliças</h3><ul><li><p>Encha <strong>meio prato de verduras e legumes</strong> no almoço e no jantar.</p></li><li><p>Varie as cores: quanto mais colorido, mais vitaminas e minerais.</p></li></ul><h3>💧 Hidratação</h3><ul><li><p>Beba <strong>1,5 a 2 litros de água por dia</strong> (a menos que seu médico recomende restrição).</p></li><li><p>Evite bebidas açucaradas.</p></li></ul><hr><h2>3. Como tomar seus remédios</h2><p>Os medicamentos orais ajudam a controlar a glicemia.<br><strong>Regras gerais</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Horário fixo</strong>: tome sempre no mesmo horário para manter o efeito constante.</p></li><li><p><strong>Não interrompa</strong> o tratamento mesmo que a glicemia melhore.</p></li><li><p>Se esquecer uma dose: tome assim que lembrar, mas se estiver perto do próximo horário, pule a esquecida (não dobre a dose).</p></li><li><p>Informe seu médico sobre <strong>efeitos colaterais</strong> (náuseas, tonturas, diarreia).</p></li></ul><hr><h2>4. Uso de insulina</h2><p>Se você usa insulina, siga estas orientações básicas:</p><h3>📍 Armazenamento</h3><ul><li><p>Mantenha insulina <strong>não aberta na geladeira</strong> (2–8 °C).</p></li><li><p>A insulina <strong>em uso</strong> pode ficar fora da geladeira por até 30 dias (em local fresco, longe da luz).</p></li></ul><h3>💉 Aplicação</h3><ul><li><p>Siga a dose e os horários prescritos.</p></li><li><p>Injete no subcutâneo (barriga, coxa, braço).</p></li><li><p><strong>Rotacione os locais</strong> para evitar endurecimento da pele (lipodistrofia).</p></li></ul><h3>🕒 Tipos de insulina</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Rápida / ultrarrápida</strong>: antes das refeições.</p></li><li><p><strong>NPH / lenta</strong>: para controle basal, geralmente 1 ou 2 vezes ao dia.</p></li><li><p><strong>Misturas</strong>: combinam rápida e intermediária.</p></li></ul><h3>⚠ Atenção para hipoglicemia</h3><ul><li><p>Sintomas: tremores, suor frio, palpitação, fome intensa, confusão mental.</p></li><li><p>Conduta: ingerir <strong>15 g de carboidrato simples</strong> (ex.: 1 copo de suco de laranja ou 1 colher de sopa de açúcar dissolvida em água) e medir a glicemia.</p></li></ul><hr><h2>5. Monitoramento da glicose</h2><ul><li><p>Use o glicosímetro conforme orientação.</p></li><li><p>Frequência comum: antes das refeições, antes de dormir e, às vezes, de madrugada.</p></li><li><p>Anote os valores para mostrar ao médico.</p></li></ul><hr><h2>6. Atividade física</h2><ul><li><p><strong>30 minutos por dia</strong> de atividade moderada (caminhada, bicicleta, hidroginástica).</p></li><li><p>Não se exercite em jejum prolongado — risco de hipoglicemia.</p></li><li><p>Leve sempre um <strong>lanchinho</strong> se usar insulina ou medicamentos que podem baixar o açúcar.</p></li></ul><hr><h2>7. Cuidados com os pés</h2><ul><li><p>Examine os pés todos os dias (feridas podem passar despercebidas).</p></li><li><p>Mantenha a pele hidratada (exceto entre os dedos).</p></li><li><p>Use calçados confortáveis e meias de algodão.</p></li><li><p>Procure atendimento ao menor sinal de ferida, bolha ou mudança na cor.</p></li></ul><hr><h2>8. Consultas e exames</h2><ul><li><p>Retorno médico regular (normalmente a cada 3 meses).</p></li><li><p>Exames importantes:</p><ul><li><p>Hemoglobina glicada (HbA1c)</p></li><li><p>Exame de urina (microalbuminúria)</p></li><li><p>Exame de fundo de olho</p></li><li><p>Avaliação dos pés e nervos</p></li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2>9. Sinais de alerta — Procure ajuda imediata</h2><ul><li><p>Hipoglicemia grave (desmaio ou convulsão)</p></li><li><p>Glicemia persistentemente &gt; 300 mg/dL</p></li><li><p>Sede excessiva, urina frequente, cansaço intenso</p></li><li><p>Febre, infecção, feridas que não cicatrizam</p></li></ul><hr><h2>10. Lembre-se</h2><ul><li><p>Diabetes <strong>não é uma sentença de doença grave</strong> se for bem controlado.</p></li><li><p>Com disciplina e acompanhamento, é possível viver com qualidade e evitar complicações.</p></li></ul>"

Popularmente, chamamos de “desmaio”.<br>Ela ocorre porque, por alguns segundos, o cérebro recebe menos sangue e oxigênio do que o necessário.</p><h2>Causas mais comuns</h2><p>Existem várias causas de síncope, mas a mais frequente, especialmente em pessoas jovens e saudáveis, é a <strong>síncope vasovagal</strong>.</p><h3>Síncope vasovagal</h3><ul><li><p>É desencadeada por fatores como dor intensa, emoções fortes, calor excessivo, jejum prolongado, ficar muito tempo em pé ou ver sangue.</p></li><li><p>O organismo responde de forma exagerada, levando à queda da pressão arterial e diminuição da frequência cardíaca.</p></li><li><p>Isso reduz temporariamente o fluxo de sangue para o cérebro, causando o desmaio.</p></li></ul><h2>Sintomas de alerta (antes do desmaio)</h2><p>Muitas vezes a síncope vasovagal dá sinais de que está para acontecer. Esses sintomas são chamados de <strong>pródromos</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Sensação de tontura ou instabilidade</p></li><li><p>Visão turva ou “escurecimento da visão”</p></li><li><p>Sudorese fria</p></li><li><p>Náusea</p></li><li><p>Fraqueza súbita</p></li><li><p>Palidez</p></li></ul><p>Reconhecer esses sinais é importante para agir rapidamente.</p><h2>O que fazer diante de uma crise</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Deitar a pessoa no chão</strong> ou sentá-la com a cabeça entre os joelhos, para favorecer o fluxo de sangue ao cérebro.</p></li><li><p><strong>Elevar as pernas</strong> quando possível.</p></li><li><p><strong>Afrouxar roupas apertadas</strong> (gola, cinto).</p></li><li><p>Garantir que o ambiente esteja arejado.</p></li><li><p>Aguardar: a recuperação costuma ser rápida, em 1 a 2 minutos.</p></li><li><p><strong>Não oferecer água ou alimentos imediatamente</strong> enquanto a pessoa ainda estiver desacordada, para evitar engasgos.</p></li><li><p>Após acordar, permitir repouso em posição deitada até melhora total.</p></li></ol><h2>Quando procurar atendimento médico</h2><p>Apesar de a síncope vasovagal ser benigna na maioria das vezes, é importante procurar avaliação médica quando:</p><ul><li><p>Os episódios são frequentes ou recorrentes.</p></li><li><p>O desmaio aconteceu durante esforço físico.</p></li><li><p>Houve lesões decorrentes da queda.</p></li><li><p>A pessoa não recuperou a consciência em poucos minutos.</p></li><li><p>Há histórico de doenças cardíacas ou familiares com morte súbita.</p></li><li><p>O desmaio foi acompanhado de dor no peito, palpitações fortes ou falta de ar.</p></li></ul><h2>Como prevenir novos episódios</h2><ul><li><p>Evitar ficar muito tempo em pé, principalmente em ambientes quentes e fechados.</p></li><li><p>Alimentar-se regularmente, evitando longos períodos de jejum.</p></li><li><p>Manter hidratação adequada (beber água ao longo do dia).</p></li><li><p>Ao perceber os sinais de alerta, <strong>sentar ou deitar imediatamente</strong>, antes de perder a consciência.</p></li><li><p>Praticar exercícios orientados, quando recomendados pelo médico, que podem ajudar a reduzir a sensibilidade do reflexo vasovagal.</p></li><li><p>Em alguns casos, o médico pode ensinar manobras físicas (como contrair as pernas e braços) para aumentar a pressão arterial no início dos sintomas.</p></li></ul><h2>Conclusão</h2><p>A síncope vasovagal é a causa mais comum de desmaios e, na maioria das vezes, não representa risco grave. Ainda assim, deve sempre ser investigada para excluir outras causas. Com medidas simples de prevenção e reconhecimento precoce dos sinais, é possível reduzir bastante o risco de quedas e acidentes.</p>"
